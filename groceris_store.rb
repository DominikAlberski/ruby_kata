# Ever since you started work at the grocer, you have been faithfully logging
# down each item and its category that passes through. One day, your boss walks
# in and asks, "Why are we just randomly placing the items everywhere? It's too
# difficult to find anything in this place!" Now's your chance to improve the
# system, impress your boss, and get that raise!

# The input is a comma-separated list with category as the prefix in the form
# "fruit_banana". Your task is to group each item into the 4 categories Fruit,
# Meat, Other, Vegetable and output a string with a category on each line
# followed by a sorted comma-separated list of items.

# For example, given:
# "fruit_banana,vegetable_carrot,fruit_apple,canned_sardines,drink_juice,fruit_orange"

# output:
# "fruit:apple,banana,orange\nmeat:\nother:juice,sardines\nvegetable:carrot"
